## Political Differences in Romantic Relationships

One line of research focuses on romantic couples with differing political beliefs. How common are such relationships, and how does this difference affect relationship quality? My collaborators at the University of Michigan, Amie M. Gordon and Annika from, and I found that while cross-party relationships are rare, this difference has a slight negative impact on relationship quality.

## Intellectual Humility and Couples' Conflict Styles

Another research line with Ozlem Ayduk and Tyrone Sgambati at UC Berkeley is the role of intellectual humility in facilitating prosocial conflict styles in couples. Preliminary findings suggest that intellectual humility -- a person's understanding that their cognitive capacities are fallible and they may be wrong -- is associated with better relationship functioning and less-frequent conflict. Further, this construct appears to be related to more collaborative and cooperative conflict communication styles.

## Sleep and Authenticity in Stranger Dyads

A third research area deals with the formation of new interpersonal relationships. In an ongoing study, my colleagues at UC Berkeley and I are investigating how little or poor-quality sleep may impact stranger interactions through a mechanism of felt and perceived authenticity. This work is with Belinda Carrillo, Lindsey Deringer, and Serena Chen.
